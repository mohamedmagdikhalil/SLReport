\section{Motivation}
In the motivation, we should write a line or two about why we want to do this. Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item An integrated environment of analysis and design compared to separate CAD and FEM packages
\item Using HOFEM to obtain a conforming elements to the shaft's geometry and possibly for the features as well since they all have a closed-form geometric description
\end{itemize}

% Students should also prepare a Poster as part of the final documentation. Please, remember that the poster is the first contact for the other students with your topic, should wake up their attention and guide them to the paper to get more information. Poster and paper are NOT the same document, but two different ways to present your results.
